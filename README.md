# Clock

It's a timezone-aware clock that works without JavaScript. 

Just pure HTML and CSS (at least on the client-side).

It uses the [Geo Open database](https://data.public.lu/en/datasets/geo-open-ip-address-geolocation-per-country-in-mmdb-format/) to guess the country (and then timezone) of the clients using their IP address.

Sometimes it can be wrong, though.
